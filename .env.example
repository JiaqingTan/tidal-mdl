# Quality options:
#   NORMAL   - 96kbps AAC  (.m4a)
#   HIGH     - 320kbps AAC (.m4a)
#   LOSSLESS - FLAC 16-bit 44.1kHz (.flac)
#   HI_RES   - FLAC up to 24-bit 192kHz (.flac)
#
# Fallback: If requested quality is unavailable, automatically tries lower qualities:
#   HI_RES -> LOSSLESS -> HIGH -> NORMAL
#
# IMPORTANT: HI_RES/LOSSLESS streams are delivered via DASH with FLAC audio inside MP4 container.
# If FFmpeg is installed, files are automatically remuxed to native .flac format (lossless operation).
# If FFmpeg is NOT installed, FLAC audio is saved in .m4a container (still lossless, but less compatible).
# Install FFmpeg: brew install ffmpeg (macOS) or apt install ffmpeg (Linux)
